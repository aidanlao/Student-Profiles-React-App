# Student Profile Creator
This React web app was created in August 2022 to help students of my grade 12 Coding Club to create, read, update, and delete student profiles of club members.
It's a great proof of concepet that can be improved further in terms of UI and styling later on.
# What it does:
Allows students to read the student profiles of club memnbers, to give them information like their name, date joined, and description. 
There's a separate tab featured that permits executive members to create student profiles and edit them as well. 
# How to run
To test the program, start the client and server separately using npm start
